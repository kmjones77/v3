One of the key aspects of working with numbers in Ruby is the distinction between integers (numbers with no digits after the decimal separator) and floating-point numbers (numbers with zero or more digits after the decimal separator).
They are implemented through the [`Integer`][integer-ruby] and [`Float`][float-ruby] class.

```ruby
a = 1
b = 1.0;
a.class
#=> Integer
b.class
#=> Float
```

- Arithmetic is done using the basic [arithmetic operators][arithmetic-operators] (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). Numbers can be compared using the standard [comparison operators][comparison-operators].
- Basic arithmetic operations between instances of `Integer`, will always result in an instance of `Integer`.
- Basic arithmetic operations between instances of `Float` will result in other instances of `Float`.
- Basic arithmetic operations between instances of `Integer` and instances of `Float` will result in instances of `Float`.
- Both instances of `Float` and `Integer` implement methods (for example: `#to_i`, `#to_f`) to convert values from one type to the other. As a number implemented through the `Integer` class has less precision than a number implemented through the `Float` class, converting from an instance of `Integer` to an instance of `Float` is safe because it does not result in any kind of data loss. However, converting from an instance of `Float` to an instance of `Integer` could mean losing data.

```ruby
4.9.to_i
#=> 4

5.to_f
#=> 5.0

5 * 6
#=> 30

1.2 > 0.8
#=> true

3.0 > 3
#=> false

7 - 3.0
#=> 4.0

2 != 4
#=> true
```

An `if` statement can be used to conditionally execute code. The condition of an `if` statement does not have to be only `true` or `false`. It can be any value. But it's important to know that any value other than `nil` and `false` (_truthy_ values) will be treated as `true`, meaning that the code inside the `if` statement will be executed.

```ruby
x = 5

if x == 5
  # Execute logic if x equals 5
elsif x > 7
  # Execute logic if x greater than 7
else
  # Execute logic in all other cases
end
```

Sometimes you want to execute a piece of code if a condition is _not_ true, for situations like that, Ruby implements the `unless` statement:

```ruby
x = 4
unless x == 5
  # Execute logic if x does not equal 5
else
  # Execute logic if x == 5
end
```

Ruby also implements the `case` statement:

```ruby
y = 5
case y
when 3
  # Execute logic if y equals 3
when 5
  # Execute logic if y equals 5
else
  #Exectue logic in all other cases
end
```
